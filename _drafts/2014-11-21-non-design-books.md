[Yuri Victor](https://twitter.com/yurivictor/status/535540725019344896) recently asked on Twitter what people's favorite design/code books were. Trying to answer that question, I was struck by two things: One, that my favorite books about design and code weren't about technical knowledge at all, and Two, some of my favorite books about design aren't even about design in the first place.
