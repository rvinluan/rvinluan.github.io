> You hate bloggers, you mock Twitter, you don't even have a Facebook page! You're the one who doesn't exist!

> -Emma Stone, Birdman

I just saw Birdman recently and while there are many many things to praise about the film, one of its weak points for me was its portrayal of social media. It's something I feel like a lot of modern movies and tv shows get wrong or at the very least do awkwardly, and in Birdman in particular this portrayal is characterized by three main sins:

1. The idea that social media is mysterious and/or confusing; something that only millenials know anything about
2. The over-emphasis on views and follower counts, particularly in short periods of time (things going "viral")
3. The lack of concrete impact of the actual people who are being interacted with

Generally I find that depictions that fall victim the three crimes above tend to come across as soulless, or distant. Like they don't really understand what social media is about, how it's used, or what people get out of it. Often the picture painted of social media is of a completely separate world, a world that nobody understands because it operates under different rules. In Birdman, Emma Stone's character even refers to it as a separate place: "a place that you ignore", a place that "has already forgotten about you".

Of course, this interpretation works within the universe of the film. Because the audience is watching from the perspective of Michael Keaton's character, of course the idea of social media to him would seem alien. The fact that it is portrayed as this world that it some senses his daughter is the gatekeeper of (she creates and posts to his Twitter account) is a defining aspect of their relationship; In a way, the distance he feels to Twitter is the same distance he is feels to his daughter.
