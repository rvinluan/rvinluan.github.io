Warner Brothers, the studio producing the Ready Player One movie, just announced it scored Steven Spielberg as the director for the film adaptation of the bestselling novel (which it aqcuired the rights to in 2010, a year before the book was even realeased). 

It's exciting and the prospects (and expectations) for the film couldn't be any higher. But there's one thing that multiple sources have mentioned that I find interesting: virtual reality.

The list of things that make Ready Player One an appealing specimen for Hollywood is already long: dystopian sci-fi, wizard AND mech battles, teenage romance, video games, and of course, pop culture references out the wazoo.
