[The New School's new branding by Pentagram](http://new.pentagram.com/2015/03/new-work-the-new-school/) lit up social medias yesterday, mostly to disbelief and disgust and jokes about Star Wars.

[Design criticism is a spectator sport now,](http://designobserver.com/feature/graphic-design-criticism-as-a-spectator-sport/37607/) and it's impossible to rebrand anything in this day and age without everyone and their mother "joining the conversation", as brands like to say. 

The varyting widths thing feels like wants to be [The Public Theater Identity](http://new.pentagram.com/2008/06/new-work-the-public-theater-1/) really bad (also designed by Paula Scher).

> The New School is a place for us to grow, learn and become better individuals thorough the experiences it has to offer. The new identity exists and is a reality and it has set the ground-work for “potential” through a visual system, but the work is not done. We must take advantage of this empowering identity of both unity and diversity and grasp the opportunity to collaborate and grow as school, not just as individuals.
