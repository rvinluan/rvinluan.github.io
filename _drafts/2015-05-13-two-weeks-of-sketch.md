After using Sketch for about two weeks now, I've been surprised at how quickly I've adapted to it. I felt like I should write a comprehensive list of where I'm at with it, just in case anyone was pondering making the switch.

##Good
exporting!
smart guide functionality (+ weaknesses)
shared styles, although could be smarter?
dragging values around
artboards
automatic layouts and adjustable grids
creating new plugins
smart alignments
	but also not smart alignments -- key object?


##Bad
crating new shortcuts
lack of a move tool
typography capabilities
	typeface chooser
    lack of a glyphs panel
copy paste
fast border/fill adjustments
having to hit enter when filling in hex values
less precise pen tool
