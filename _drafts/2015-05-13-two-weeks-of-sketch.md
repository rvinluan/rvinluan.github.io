People are still talking about switching to Sketch, so I figured I'd throw my two cents in. Except, since this is an oft-blogged subject, the well I'm throwing them into is already overflowing with other designers' pocket change.

After using Sketch for about two weeks now, I've been surprised at how quickly I've adapted to it. I felt like I should write a comprehensive list of where I'm at with it, just in case anyone was pondering making the switch.

##Good
exporting!
smart guide functionality (+ weaknesses)
shared styles, although could be smarter?
dragging values around
artboards
automatic layouts and adjustable grids
creating new plugins
smart alignments
	but also not smart alignments -- key object?


##Bad
crating new shortcuts
lack of a move tool
typography capabilities
	typeface chooser
    lack of a glyphs panel
copy paste
fast border/fill adjustments
having to hit enter when filling in hex values
less precise pen tool
