I see Tweets like this sometimes, and they're always pretty funny, so I wanted to see if I could build a bot that generates phrases of the same form. I figured it'd be a good opportunity for some funny juxtapostions as well as a good exercise in working with structured grammars and also I haven't built a Twitter bot in a while, so last weekend I sat down and coded it up.
