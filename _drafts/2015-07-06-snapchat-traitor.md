###The Problem

I have a group of 10 friends that I've known since we were 1-2 years old (our parents are friends). When we hang out we can be up to 14, depending on who is present plus other friends and significant others. We like to play a lot of games (video and board and all other kinds), but it's hard to find good ones mainly because 1) we're such a large group and 2) we like to keep it very casual.

###This weekend

We played a game that goes like this: Each player gets a sheet of paper with an object written on it. Everyone has the same object, except for one person, who has a different object. You go around each saying a statement about your object. After everyone has gone once, you vote on who you think was the odd one out.

I'm not sure what this game is called, in fact [I'm not even sure it has an official name](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/31b8ks/what_are_some_games_you_can_play_with_just_a/cq04wz2). But I've heard it called 'Traitor', so let's go with that.

###Some more logistical stuff

The person who is the 'traitor' does not know they are the traitor. This is part of the game. Because of this, the person who writes down the objects can't participate. But the moderator role tends to be more fun anyway, because you get to hear what people come up with and how it could apply to both things.

We played it casually, but 

###Why are you writing a blog post about this

Because we played it via Snapchat, which I thought was interesting.

As far as I know, Traitor is a folk game. That means there isn't a single canonical set of rules, and you can't buy it in a box that comes with everything you need to play. So in lieu of those things, we had to figure a few things out.

For one, we didn't want to waste paper. There were 12 of us, and we didn't want to do all the work involved with setting up this game using physical materials: ripping a piece of paper into 12 pieces, writing down the same thing on all of them, finding a bowl/hat to put them in, shuffling them up, and then passing it around.
