ok wait wait wait. Let's talk about this for a second.

If this were a 50s style instructional video, this is where the two actors playing designers on screen would suddenly pause, and I'd come out and introduce myself, mention that you may recognize me from such design related blog posts as etc etc. 

And then I would say this: Have you ever been in this situation? Have you ever debated which design tool to use, or how it fits into your process? Have you been told, either by a well meaning colleague or a clickbait-y blog post (or gasp, marketing material) that you should use something newer and/or shinier? Have you ever gotten into a fight about it?

We talk about tools too much, I think. Designers of all kinds: I design digital products (websites and apps, as I clarify to my high school friends that went into finance), but I know plenty of industrial designers (*physical* products) who will gladly spend hours conversing about how much better Rhino is than SolidWorks (or is it the other way around?).

If you're having design tool problems I feel bad for you son, but the sharp rise in the number of tools for digital designers is probably a response to an equally sharp rise of those new to the field who, as the field evolves, grow increasingly fed up with old methods, so we should be glad that there is no shortage of people who are eager to fill our needs. And/or take our money.

But although the space for new hi-tech design tools for things like prototyping and animation was previously wide open, it's gotten increasingly crowded in recent years, and more crowding means more overlap between what those tools do, and more overlap means more arguing, more confusion, more unrest. Luckly we're not at Vim vs Emacs levels just yet, but we do have, for example, a whole movement dedicated to being anti-psd.

What can you do about it as a designer? What I've found is that it helps to change your state of mind. If you're trying to decide what tool to use, don't think about what stage of the process you're in, or what deliverable you want to get out of it. Think about what question you're trying to answer.

If you set out to create a wireframe, you'll probably be choosing between OmniGraffle and Balsamic. Or pencil and paper. Or you could use Photoshop or Illustrator or Sketch if you're comfortable enough. But inevitably two things will happen: for one, you'll get distracted by details and microefficiencies that don't really matter for your work. You'll spend a long time obsessing over which program allows you to center things best, or which one has presets for icons that you use. Two, you'll want to expand. You'll decide that your black and white line drawing doesn't communicate what you wish to communicate effectively, and you'll want real typography, or clickable states, or scripting, and you'll email the creators of the tool and they'll add it and then the tool will become bloated, so people abandon it for a more streamlined--wait. I'm getting Deja Vu.

So don't set out to make a wireframe. Instead, set out to answer questions. Questions like: How important is the nav relative to everything else? What different things can I group together? What kind of logic drives whether or not this module shows up? Wireframes are good at answering those questions. But you'll also find, if you're doing it right, that there are other things that can answer your questions too. Card sorting is a good way to decide what belongs on a page vs what doesn't belong. Quick mockups in Photoshop will let you know how long titles and descriptions can be, based on your typography.

There's a second benefit as well: by limiting your exercise to a few questions you avoid catching the dreaded scope creep (or at least the design equivalent of it). Often we have to battle implicit assumptions baked into our designs that aren't exactly "ready" for the current stage the project is in: we have caveats like "ignore these, they're placeholder." By lasering in on answering a specific question, it's a lot easier to get everyone on the same page about what is a part of your design and what isn't.

Of course this method isn't perfect (I'm not one to peddle "One Weird Trick"s). You can't fully answer a question like "how important are the share tools" with one tool. You also can't 100% prevent other people misinterpreting your intentions; to a certain extent that's up to your communication skills (and the people on the recieving end of them). 

I want to know what people think of this. I've found it helps a lot but I can only speak for my process and my experience. If you have anything to add or correct definitely let me know.
