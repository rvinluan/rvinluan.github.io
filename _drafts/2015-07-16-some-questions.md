Here's a short list of fun questions I've found that are great for asking people, or a group of people. In general, all of them meet the following requirements: They don't require a lot of thinking, the answers are entertaining to whomever is listening, and they reveal a lot about the person answering.

These are useful for small talk at parties, icebreakers when you're meeting new people (or forced to interact in a group), interview style podcasts, or even formal job interviews.

###1. What's the story behind your shoes?

Credit to [Robert Yang](https://twitter.com/radiatoryang) for this one, who used this to get all of his students to introduce themselves on the first day of his class. Surprisingly, everyone had an interesting story to tell -- usually revealing something about their tastes or backgrounds.

###2. Tell your favorite joke.

This one is [Tina Roth Eisenberg's:](https://spoken.co/t/2316675) she screens all her job applicants with this question. It says a ton about the person and is a great way to make friends and get a laugh out of it.

###3. What's the hardest time you've ever laughed?

This question is the hardest on the list for most people, but it guarantees a great story for those involved. This is a standby of Pete Holmes's great podcast [You Made It Weird](http://nerdist.com/tag/you-made-it-weird/).

###4. If you were trapped in a bookstore for an hour, what section would you spend it in?

Everyone has really strong opinions about this.

###5. What are you looking forward to?

This is probably the question that meets all 3 requirements best. It also has the bonus of being great for discussion, because a lot of people default to talking about vacations and that always invites helpful contributions from fellow travelers.

###6. On a scale of 1 to 10, what are you a 10 at?

The best thing about this one is that it can go either way. Lots of people end up being self-deprecating, and those answers are sometimes better. If you want, you can also ask people what they are 1s at. This one comes from an [AskReddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/3dg2gp/).
