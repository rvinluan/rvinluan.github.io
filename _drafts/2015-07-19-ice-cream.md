"Is it...taro?"

"No, it's Harvest Berry. good guess though."

They gave me the tiniest plastic spoon to eat the ice cream with, a size most places reserve for samples. I take the tiny spoon and scrape off a tiny spoonful with it, pulling it onto my tongue, savoring it like I've seen taste testers do in videos. I make a mouth motion that supposedly airates the ice cream such that it covers all 4000 taste buds and it creates a satisfying smack.

"Although I can definitely taste something...root-y. I think if you told me this was purple yam flavored I'd believe you."

Victor nods.

"Let's walk."

We make our way through the crowds and I have to look back occasionally to make sure Victor is still tailing me. It was just raining an hour ago, which I had hoped would mean fewer people but that didn't seem to be the case. That and the fact that Seamless was delivering food from this festival for one day only, meaning that there should have at least been a few dozen Williamsburg-ites who opted to forgo joining in the mass migration from the Bedford Ave Subway to the chaotic writhing mass of foodies that inhabit Smorgasburg on Summer Saturday afternoons. But even Seamless's hyper-local marketing stunt didn't seem to cause a noticeable dent in the fair's attendance; if anything the delivery startup's red-shirted liasons and smocked delivery-boys-for-hire were even more noticeable as Victor and I finally found the exit, in front of which they were frantically scrambling to get orders together.

After a few blocks south I stop eating the ice cream and stare at it. "I think I'm allergic to something in here." Victor is unsure how to react, but he manages an "uh oh". I can feel an itch in the back of my throat, and that's the first sign. Squinting at the now melting pile, I make out some consipicous speckles. Could those be nuts? Or am I seeing things? I play back the memory of ordering in my head. No asterisks next to the name of the flavor. How could Harvest Berry have anything but berries in it?

I toss the ice cream in a corner garbage can and assure Victor that all this is just a mild inconvenience. My mouth will get irritated and maybe a bit swollen but I'll go home and take Benadryl and maybe a nap and I should still be able to make it to my friend's birthday party later. "I'm more upset at the fact that the medicine will make me drowsy", I tell him, although I'm saying this more for myself.

I'm showing Victor around the neighborhood because he's moving here in a month, and I point out all the restaurants and bars and stores and the place where I get my hair cut. The itchiness is on my tongue now, and I can feel that my throat is a little tighter when I try to clear my congestion. I wasn't congested a few minutes ago. I have to stop for a tissue but there's nobody at the counter of M Noodle Shop, "which is great because it's open really late", I say to Victor. I'm not sure if he notices me struggling with my tour guide duties while simultaneously dealing with a sudden onslaught of mucus that I'm trying to evict like a delinquent tenant with nowhere to go.

On the corner of Metropolitan and Lorimer I stumble into Bagelsmith and grab napkins from the counter, and then hastily wish Victor goodbye in front of the Subway
