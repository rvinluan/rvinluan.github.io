<p class="intro">This is part 1 of a devlog for a game I'm developing. I hope it's interesting to you!</p>

After getting super into Threes!, and writing a very long blog post about what made its game design great, I felt like I should take a stab at an abstract puzzle game. This is the story of developing that puzzle game and how it has evolved over time.

Oh and when I say 'development' I mean 'design' mostly. That's more interesting to me. But if you would like to know technical things as well feel free to hit me up.

###How do you make a puzzle game?

The idea at its base was this: 4 snake-like monsters that ate 4 different colored blocks on an 8x8 grid. The idea was that you would drag the monsters around and they would eat leaves, and you would get points for eating the correct color. But you would have to balance moving around all 4, because if you moved one around too much it would eat up all the leaves of its color and die.

I made a prototype of the game in Javascript (the language I code the fastest in) just to make sure I wasn't going crazy, and it was actually pretty engaging: you had to think ahead or else you would lose, and occasionally you would pull off a pretty cool maneuver that made you last longer than you thought you could.

There were two key things that were in the game at this point that were pretty crucial:

1) when you moved a monster, leaves regenerated behind it, but never of its own color. This ensured you couldn't move one around too much without having to move the other monsters eventually.

2) your final score is the score of the monster with the least points. This is a game mechanic I ripped directly from the board game Ingenious. Because your whole goal was to keep advanc

After all that, it looked like this:
