If you don't watch Cutthroat Kitchen I'm about to tell you why you should. Ready? Here's the gist.

Four chefs compete to be the last one standing after a series of challenges. Before each challenge, they bid in auctions for sabotages against their opponents. For example, they can force one of their opponents to do all their cooking on a camp stove, or prevent them from being able to use salt. At the beginning of the game they are each given $25,000 to spend in the auctions. At the end of the game, the last chef standing goes home with however much money he/she didn't spend.

So right away you have an interesting tension: spend too much, and you go home with no winnings. Spend too little, and your opponents win the auctions and eliminate you. Of course, the game has a lot more to it than that. Let's dive in.

###Auction Mechanics

At the heart of the game is its auction mechanic. To understand how the game works, it's important to understand how auctions work in general. You know this already, but bear with me for a sec.
