If you don't watch Cutthroat Kitchen I'm about to tell you why you should. Ready? Here's the gist.

Four chefs compete to be the last one standing after a series of challenges. Before each challenge, they bid in auctions for sabotages against their opponents. For example, they can force one of their opponents to do all their cooking on a camp stove, or prevent them from being able to use salt. At the beginning of the game they are each given $25,000 to spend in the auctions. At the end of the game, the last chef standing goes home with however much money he/she didn't spend.

Right away you have an interesting tension: spend too much, and you go home with no winnings. Spend too little, and your opponents win the auctions and eliminate you. Of course, the game has a lot more to it than that. Let's dive in.

###Auction Mechanics

At the heart of the game is its auction mechanic. To understand how the game works, let's break down how auctions work in general. Or specifically, Open Auctions, which is what Cutthroat Kitchen uses, although [there are other types]().

Auctions rely on two things: 1 is that the money you're bidding with has to have some value beyond the fact that it's winning you the auction. 2 is that different players have to value the same thing differently.

The first one sounds weird but is actually very important. In a real world auction, this is not much of a point, but isolated within a game, it's more important to keep in mind. Consider what would happen if, at the end of the game, the winner went home with $25,000 regardless of how much money he/she spent. Suddenly, the best option is to spend all your money. Actually, in the early rounds, there wouldn't be much difference, because bidding low is driven by the need to save money for later rounds. But since you more or less have an idea of how many auctions there are, the amount of money you should bid simply becomes a math problem. In the final round, bidding becomes pointless: everyone just immediately spends all the money they have left.

I actually have a real world anecdote that demonstrates this well. I had a friend, let's call him Paul (not his real name), whos Bar-Mitzvah I attended in 8th grade. During the party he would hand out "Paul-Dollars", a fake currency with his face printed on it, for various thing
