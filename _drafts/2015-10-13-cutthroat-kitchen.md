If you don't watch Cutthroat Kitchen I'm about to tell you why you should. Ready? Here's the gist.

Four chefs compete to be the last one standing after a series of challenges. Before each challenge, they bid in auctions for sabotages against their opponents. For example, they can force one of their opponents to do all their cooking on a camp stove, or prevent them from being able to use salt. At the beginning of the game they are each given $25,000 to spend in the auctions. At the end of the game, the last chef standing goes home with however much money he/she didn't spend.
