Joel tweeted this storm earlier and I generally agree and stuff, negativity and cynicism is bad, etc etc, but one of the things that stuck out to me is that, centrally, a lot of negativity stems from our inability to critique properly. This is *not just limited to design*; I see it all over the internet.

Anyway, if you want to be good at giving feedback and not being a wet blanket, here are some things that are imperative to remember:

1. Your goal when giving feedback is to make the thing better.

2. Your goal is NOT to judge whether or not it is good.

3. You should have a reason for *why you think* what you think.

4. You should have a reason for *why you are telling them* what you are telling them.

5. Your comments should always *open up* room for conversation, rather than *shut it down*.

Number 5 is really the point of everything. If there's a single thing that separates good critique from bad critique, it's that good critique has substance that can be latched onto in order to start a conversation. Here's an example of awful critique: ["Typographic traffic jam. So heavy and distracting. That logo repeat pattern is, is â€¦ I hate this."](http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_the_new_school_by_pentagram.php#comment-1937698841)

If you're a person on the receiving end of that critique, how are you supposed to respond? "No it's not?" "It's cool that you hate it but I like it?" Every sentence of that critique is empty, and thus the only way to respond is to completely negate it. That's what leads to arguments and flame wars and other nastiness. 

Here's a better version of the exact same feedback, but taking our 5 things into account: "The letters are bumping up against each other and the detail starts to disappear and become hard to read at small sizes. It works better in large sizes when the odd forms aren't distracting."

The person hearing this has a lot to go off of. They can talk actually talk about *why* they chose to use it at small sizes. They can use that as a lead-in to talk about context that maybe the critiquer is unaware of. They even have some suggestings for improving it in the future, and they can talk about why that will or maybe not work.

Above all, the SUPER IMPORTANT thing to remember, if you take away anything from this, is that **the person recieving your critique is a HUMAN BEING.** Treat that human with respect as you should all humans. They have the same wants and hopes fears and insecurities. And **fundamentally, they have made themselves vulnerable by sharing something with you.** Don't exploit that vulnerability by giving bad critique.
