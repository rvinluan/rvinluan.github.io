I legitimately think it's kinda neat that whenever Twitter launches a new product feature, hundreds (thousands?) of people start tweeting about whether or not it's good or bad.

Sure yeah, that's probably annoying to the people at Twitter, [who have no doubt spent a lot of time researching and testing said change,](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/twitter-unfaves-itself-hearts/413917/) only to have people blow up in a matter of seconds (and then forget about it or get used to it a few days later). 

And for another thing, the people venting are probably [not the audience Twitter cares most about](http://www.engadget.com/2015/10/27/twitter-q3-2015/).
