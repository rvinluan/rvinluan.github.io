One of the things I've been realizing through the course of my life is that racism, at the very least the casual, non-psychopathic kind, is a function of lack of empathy, and that lack of empathy is a function of one's life experiences, and the life experiences one has been exposed to.

I've heard stories of people growing up in a town so white they thought black people were fantasy, like elves.

You'd think statistics would help, like the statistic that police kill 5 times as many black people a year than they do white people. But statistics are just numbers, so they don't increase your empathy. What we need are human stories, because that's the difference between hearing about a shooting on the news and picturing a hypothetical black person, and hearing about a shooting on the news and picturing your friend, or your cousin, or your teacher. 

A lot of social justice rhetoric doesn't make sense if you think that the things it is a response to are rare. People who complain about 'outrage culture' or who think that 'political corectness has run amok' are reosponding to what they see as a disproportionate response from people who are 'angry about things that aren't a big deal'. But they think it's about Anton, or Philando, or whoever the latest hashtag is. They think it's about a few people here and there, when it's not.

I used to be like that. Well meaning but uninformed. I used to think these things. It took me years to come around, and it happened because I was constantly surrounded by people who were sharing their experiences, sharing others' experiences, and talking openly about the stuff that happens. Deep-seated, systemic, unconscious bias doesn't change overnight, not after reading one article or one pithy tweet. But it can change over time with exposure, and I know this because it happened to me. 

Racism is a big problem that is the product of a million small problems. That means that the solution isn't one big solution, but a million tiny ones. And a million small human stories can go a really long way towards chipping away at that ingrained bias, but not if they're not heard by the people who need to hear them most.

Wednesday night into early Thursday morning my Twitter feed lit up with the news about Philando Castile. Every tweet in my feed was about it. I flipped over to Facebook and saw radio silence. Twitter's trending topics listed #PhilandoCastile and #FalconHeightsShooting. Facebook had neither. 

I'm worried about filter bubbles. I'm worried because I want people to hear these stories, because I think that makes a lot of difference. I'm worried that for all our talk about how social media is "bottom up" and that the message is in the hands of the people, that we're still beholden to the algorithms of giant corporations, whose primary interests are those of advertisers and stockholders. I've seen the visualizations of just how isolated the echo chambers can be. I've seen the cycle of mass outrage, petitions and thinkpeices that everybody talks about but nobody does anything about; the laws stay the same and the attitudes stay the same and then in a week they are all forgotten until it happens again and we're right back where we started.

I don't really know what to do from here. I can keep retweeting, but that feels like preaching to the choir. I can only urge the importance of sharing stories, of not being silent. It's been said a milltion times before, but this is especially for people 'on the sidelines'. There's undue burden on the people who are affected the most to educate others around them. If you're not one of those people, if you are merely a bystander, recognize that burden and help take some of it off. Speak as loudly as they do, or otherwise be complicit.
