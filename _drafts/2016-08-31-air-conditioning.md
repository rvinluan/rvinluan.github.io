I have a problem with my air conditioner. 

It's a portable unit, although I don't know why they call it "portable" when it outweighs me. It's a heavy, hulking thing. It's half as tall as I am, and about as wide. It's much too large for its own good, and it looks and sounds like it comes from a bygone era, like "wow can you believe they used to make them that big?" I suppose "portable" is more of a distinction from what it's not: a small, compact, window unit, a cute thing, one that you must set up initially but afterwards is largely ignorable, both metaphorically and physically, as it doesn't take up valuable floor space. I'd take that over my air conditioner any day.

Becuase my air conditoner leaks. More specifically, it doesn't evaporate the air it cools down fast enough, and although there's a hose (it's more like the size of a duct) that extends from the back that snakes out the window that blows quite the flow of hot air, there's also a tiny little tube that sticks out the bottom, that slowly and steadily, throughout the course of a day, drains about 5 gallons of excess water, drip by drip.

I have a bucket, and I don't know how big it is exactly, but I've placed it underneath the portable air conditioner (which itself is sitting atop a small table), and it catches the water that sleepily falls from my air conditioner's exhaust. I can't leave it alone for more than about 10 hours without having to empty it, which equates to about twice a day. I've forgotten about it a few times while I napped and woke up to a big puddle slowly amassing beneath the window. It's ruined at least one pair of shoes. It's the absolute worst thing to come home to drunk. 

I know you're already telling me to get a new one. I will soon, I promise. But this isn't really about how annoying it is to constaintly maintain my air conditioner, I mean it is but it's about more than that. It's about dread.

There have been times in my life when I've come home scared for something that was about to happen. Fearful of an uncertain future. The times in which I felt suffocated for thought, visions of bad outcomes seeping in fron the edges of my consciousness. Times in which thinking about absolutely anything else, feeling any other emotion, using my brain for anything other than worrying, was impossible. Times I felt distracted, distressed, detached. If this were a song I could call it "drowning", because that's what it feels like. The water level is rising and you can't handle it, and try as you might you can't stop it, it slowly creeps ahead, threatening to overflow and just ruin everything. And you can't NOT think about it. It fills in spaces between thoughts, it grows louder in the background, it starts to desaturate even your positive feelings. And when the dread reaches its peak, when it becomes absolutely unbearable, when you're at your most vulnerable and afraid, that's when you empty the bucket.

But that only works for the air conditioner.
