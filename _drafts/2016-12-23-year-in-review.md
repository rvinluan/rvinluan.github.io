2016 was a bad year in almost every regard, but I did manage to make a lot of work. So much that I had actually forgotten about a few of these. So partially for posterity and partially to make myself feel a little better, here are the things I got done approximately month by month:

### January

I participated in Global Game Jam 2016 spending a few days in a room at Parsons with a few friends. I had this thought that most word games I've played, even the good ones, have this problem where obscure words (be they long or dense with rare letters) are almost always better to play than common ones. So I tried to come up with a game where you were explicitly trying to come up with words that had common letters in them. The idea is that you had this hand of letter tiles and when you used one, like an S for example, all the S's on the board would clear. So you're incentivized to think of as many words as you can that use as many S's.

I prototyped the gameplay in about two days not knowing whether or not it would actually work mechanically. It kind of didn't, but it was still fun to play around with and look at. I didn't complete it fully in the two days but I only had a few bits of work left that I picked up again later in the year (spoilers!).
