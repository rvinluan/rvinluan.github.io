Today is The Iceberg's 1 year anniversary! This post is called "A Year of The Iceberg", but that's kind of misleading. Mostly because I don't know if I can say it's been a year. Sure, I first launched [theiceberg.cool](theicberg.cool) 366 calendar days ago, but it hasn't been that many days of content, or thinking, or planning, or even any progress at all really. I'm simultaneously very proud of what I've done and also a very disappointed. So this post is only partially about what The Iceberg is after a year; it's also about what it isn't (and why), and hopefully about what it will be a year from now.

I. High hopes, glacial paces

- I had the idea for this for 2-3 years before ever making it
- It went through so many iterations and so many designs
- I had been building up content for that whole time and was excited to start writing about them

II. Content is hard, yo

- I started running out of posts fast
- This really needed to be original content because non-original content is hard to build sharing around
- I had so many original ideas for content but not any good ways to make fast, testable versions of those things
- What even is repeatable when the fundamental idea is that all of this is niche?

III. So what's next?
- Probably abandoning the idea of regular content. Quality over Quantity!
- Diminish external content and tweet a lot more
- New formats: text interviews, podcast, book reviews
