Last week I was sitting at a bar and I couldn't help but overhear the conversation at the table next to me: A stocky man in his early or mid-40s, wearing a baseball cap and speaking in a Bostonian accent, was explaining to his two buddies, with his smartphone out, how proud he was that the website he started a year ago had already built a decently sized following. He spoke to them about Minimum Viable Products and Monthly Active Users and how he wasn't quite ready to start looking for VC funding yet but hey, who knows. And then he said something that piqued my interest for some reason: "I have a separate web and mobile site. I don't believe in any of that responsive design stuff."

Now there's nothing wrong with having a separate mobile website, especially for the MVP of a small site that you don't expect to make a business out of. But what captured me most was his choice of the word "believe".
