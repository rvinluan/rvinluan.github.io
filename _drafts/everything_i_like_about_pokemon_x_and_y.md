What happens if I put a paragraph here?

1. It saves so freaking fast.
2. Sometimes when you go to a pokemon center the perspective will change. You can get a first person view or a way zoomed out view.
3. The pokemon center will also correctly show what kind of ball you caught your pokemon in.
4. Pokeballs with TMs in them are a different color. 
5. You can register 4 items at the same time and select them with the d-pad.
6. Your character bends down to talk to little kids.
7. When there's weather it shows up as an effect on the battle screen.
8. Your pokemon's eyes close when it's asleep.
9. You don't take poison damage outside of battle anymore.
10. Every route has a huge variety of pokemon from different generations.
11. The music. Is so good.
12. When you find an item on the ground there's a little animation of your character picking it up and putting it in his/her bag.
13. You don't have to leave the items screen to use items / give them / teach TMs.
14. You can drag held items between pokemon using the stylus.
15. Lumiose city.
