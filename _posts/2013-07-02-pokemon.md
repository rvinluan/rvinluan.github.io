*this post isn't finished yet, sorry!*

Not too long ago I came to the realization that my new Galaxy S4 had the capability to emulate certain handheld game consoles, and that I would be able to play a certain franchise of monster collecting JRPGs on the same device with which I checked Facebook while waiting for the train.

It was that, in combination with me watching a bunch of things like Ni No Kuni, Scrolls, and League of Legends, that made me wonder what it would be like if I made a modern version of pokemon. (Assuming I were actually competent, which I’m not).

I started making a list of what I liked about Pokemon, but it got too long. Instead I’ll start with a very high level statement about what makes Pokemon so good: It has a complex and deep enough battle system for an active metagame community to be built on top of it, yet it’s simple enough for kids to play.

That basically sums everything up. The battle system and the raising pokemon system have deep deep mechanics (look up a breeding guide sometime, or visit smogon) that make it really fun for people like me (whom Richard Bartle would call Explorers) who like to dig into that stuff and codify optimal strategies.

That being said though, there’s a *ton* of things I dislike about Pokemon. Nothing is perfect, after all. I wanted to make a list and compare Pokemon with some examples of similar games that do a better job. Note though that my experience with these other games are very superficial compared to my experience with Pokemon, so take that as you will.

###Logistical Problems
1. **Two Versions** Let’s start with the easiest ones first. Having two versions of each game each generation that *rely* on each other to complete the pokedex is rather insane in today’s world where people regularly complain about things like day one DLC. If this weren’t the status quo it would be unacceptable.
2. **The GTS** I haven’t played a lot of the newer generation games, but I’ve heard from a lot of people that the GTS is a shit show. I’m sure this is due to a combination of Nintendo’s existing incompetency with online multiplayer and the fact that a large portion of Pokemon’s audience is 12-year old trolls (or the people with that mindset).
3. **Event Legendaries** For a series that pushes its catchphrase “Gotta Catch’em All" so strongly, you’d think they wouldn’t make it so impossible.

###Creative Problems
1. **The Story** No villainous pokemon team has ever seemed to me to be like anything other than a group of pompous incompetent dog-kickers. The apex was in Emerald, where you faced two rival groups who could definitely argue were not entirely evil. It’s the closest Pokemon has ever gotten to deep characters, although I guess characterization is what the anime is for.
2. **The World** There are a lot of things about the Pokemon world that don’t sit well with the linear progression of the singleplayer. For one, the order of the gym leaders. It’s parodied pretty well in this rare candy comic.

###Mechanical Problems
1. **Weak Pokemon** There are Pokemon that are objectively worse than other pokemon. In an ideal game this wouldn’t be the case. Although because of evolution and the linear progression in the single game, that can’t happen. The metagame organizes itself around agreed upon tiers, and arguably the most interesting facet of the metagame is when new pokemon or moves come in and shake up absolutely everything for a while. But it’s too much of a disparity between the two modes to have your favorite mon go from being viable in the single player (pretty much everyone is) to being Never Used.
2. **Something Else** Yeah.
