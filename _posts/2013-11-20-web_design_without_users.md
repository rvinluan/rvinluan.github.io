This is a manifesto.

It's also specifically a response to two things\: Robert Yang's blog post about [Game Development Without Gamers](http://www.blog.radiator.debacle.us/2013/11/games-without-gamers-imagining-indie.html), and Ben Pieratt's announcement of his project [Internetland vs. Print](http://pieratt.com/).

In Robert's post, he talks about separating the process of game development from the game industry.

> There are two kinds of indie game developers: the ones who wanted to break away just from publishers, and the ones who want to break away from the game industry as a whole. A lot of the latter involves convincing gamers as well as the huge vast world outside of self-identified hardcore gamers to change their attitudes about what kinds of games are worth playing, worth making, and worth supporting.

It's also well worth reading [Mattie Brice's piece about this.](http://www.mattiebrice.com/end-the-video-supremacy-of-games/)

I believe we as web designers (and developers, and product people in general) can learn a lot from the Indie game community, and especially in two ways: For one, they're very good at supporting each other, whereas I feel like sometimes [we get too caught up in drama]() or [spend too much time telling others what we think is the right way to do things](). That isn't to say that I don't think that advice is useful, just that there's too much of it. I think we can benefit from supporting each other's efforts instead of criticizing them.

Second, they've done a great job at experimenting with their medium. As a culture, Indie gamers and developers value uniqueness, individual voice, and novelty. We in the web community on the other hand value appealing to mass audiences, best practices, and catering to the user. Of course one of these philosophies isn't better than the other. But as a web designer I feel we too often value what works over what could be new. We hate on things that don't work on old browsers or don't take into account as many use cases as possible. New solutions are always assessed based on opportunity cost of not changing what currently exists.

Robert and Mattie and many others are a part of the movement away from analyzing games the way that they have traditionally been analyzed: based on how many copies they sell, the mechanics they use, the appeal of the stories they tell. I propose we do a similar thing with the web: Let's create a movement where we create websites that aren't analyzed based on their user experience, their accessibility, or their potential for revenue. 

I'm not saying those websites shouldn't exist, they should absolutely continue to. The recent healthcare.gov site proves that more than anything. But they shouldn't be the sole models for judging what makes or breaks a website. Let's be more like Indie games and break the rules more often.

I'm inclined to use the term 'The Experiential Web'. I came up with this a while back during a conversation about games vs. websites and figured that the fundamental difference was that websites are completely task oriented. Websites aren't created to make you feel emotions, they're not created to tell you stories, they're not created to make you think critically about a subject or to question things. At least not primarily. So let's change that. Let's make websites that exist just for the sake of it, that try new things rather than going with what we know will work, that value making interesting points rather than reaching as many people as possible with boring ones.

There are already sites that exist that aren't meant to be user facing or even [useful in any way.](http://www.theuselessweb.com/) Toy sites, Google Chrome Experiments, and Interactive Art, Films, and Music videos are great examples of things already being made in this direction. But where a lot of them fall short is thinking about the web as a unique medium, rather than simply porting an experience over from some other interactive form.

Ben Pieratt recently announced a year long art project he dubbed Internetland vs. Print, and in [his blog post about it](http://blog.pieratt.com/post/65616177353/internetland-v-print-v-self) he mentions two very forward-thinking things: 

- Defining startups as art
- Introducing scrolls as a unique media format

Both of these are pursuits that basically rethink the way we use the web right now. His scrolls, as well as [Varsity](), a series of interviews only conducted in links, are examining the web as a medium in a way that most people would never do if they were concerned about user experience. Ben calls it Art; I am inclined to call it Experiential.

Some final notes:

- Novelty has its place in task-oriented websites, obviously. But only when it *also* happens to fit into the reigning model of user experience.
- Not to say that user experience is bad, either. But what user experience usually defines is the ability for your user to not be frustrated. I'm suggesting a redefinition of user experince to frame works in the context of whether the intended experience was achieved or whether the emotion was properly conveyed. And frustration can be a welcome aspect of that, instead of a taboo.
