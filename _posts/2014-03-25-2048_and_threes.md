In February of 2014, Asher Vollmer, Greg Wohlwend and Jimmy Hinson released a game called Threes. It was wildly popular, and praised for its simple yet addictive gameplay, and imaginative character and sound design. As most successful mobile games are, it was cloned many times over, in both Android and Apple App Stores, and even on the web.

In March of 2014, Gabrielle Cirulli made a game called 2048. It was a clone of the game 1024, which itself was a clone of Threes. 2048 was also wildly popular, also praised for its simple yet addictive gameplay, and also, as most successful games are, cloned many times over.

Many people have written in great lengths about the story of Threes and 2048: How Asher and Greg spent over a year designing, testing, and refining their game, only to have their thunder stolen by a bevy of clones upon release; How Gabrielle, a 19yo programmer from Italy, released a small project that became a viral hit with hundreds of thousands of players and people creating spin-offs almost weekly. Many argued about which one was better, about who deserved credit, and about whether or not hard work means anything in the end.

I'm not interested in adding to any of those discussions. Instead I want to talk about game design.

Threes and 2048 may seem very similar, but the small differences in their mechanics do a lot to separate the two in terms of gameplay and strategy. I want to take a really close look into what those mechanics are and what they do.

###1s and 2s

In 2048, the lowest block is a 2. 2s combine to make 4s which combine to make 8s and that goes on until 2048. Threes is the same way, except well, with 3s. But Threes has another really important difference: instead of 3s being the lowest block, there are 1s and 2s which cannot combine with themselves, but instead combine with each other to make 3s. 

Since 1s and 2s don't combine with themselves like all the other blocks too, they require special treatment and strategy. A *big* aspect of the strategy of Threes is managing your 1s and 2s, because if you're not careful they can build up and block your other moves. They're also worth no points, so you really want to combine them into 3s whenever possible.

###Vectors of Play

OK, Game Design Theory interlude real quick: there are these things called 'Vectors of Play' that basically describe how many goals/risks/resources you're managing at the same time. Take a car race for example: you have to manage speed, handling of the car so you don't crash, the physical and psychological limitations of your own body, and the meta position of everyone else in the race. Those are all separate vectors. If races only had one vector, speed, they'd be pointless: whoever could hold down the gas pedal longest would just win every time. Multiple vectors of play is what makes games deep and what creates interesting choices: Do I sacrifice resources in pursuit of one goal to achieve another? (e.g. Do I accelerate here to get ahead but risk going too fast to be able to turn the corner?)

2048 only has one Vector of Play: combining numbers to get a high score. Threes has at least two: combining numbers and keeping 1s and 2s from building up. (A way I like to think of it is a count of how many factors influence any given decision. In 2048 deciding which direction to move is dependent on where it places numbers that will combine. In Threes it's based on where it places numbers that will combine as well as where it places numbers that don't).

All that being said, multiple Vectors of Play make games *deeper*, but not necessarily better. One of my favorite games, Super Hexagon, arguably only has one Vector of Play: how fast your reflexes are.

###Sliding

In 2048, pressing left will slide all the blocks on the board as far left as they will go. In Threes, they'll move one space to the left. This seems like a small thing but it makes a big difference. I've heard people say that 2048's sliding is what makes it better than Threes for them, because it feels more satisfying watching blocks slide all the way across the board. But game feel isn't the only thing it affects, it also makes 2048 a lot easier.

A common element of strategy in both games is to get blocks against walls or in corners: when blocks are against walls their range of motion is limited and therefore they're less likely to go where you don't want them to. Threes's tutorial even contains an instruction to use walls to your advantage. In 2048, achieving this is much easier because whenever you press a button all the blocks hit the closest wall. You don't have to spend 2 or 3 turns positioning blocks against a wall and therefore you accrue less new blocks and your board doesn't fill up as fast.

Another aspect of 2048's sliding is that you can combine multiple blocks more easily. In 2048, if you have four 2s in a row, a single move will combine them into two 4s and then one 8, whereas in the analogous situation (of four 3s) in Threes, you'd need three swipes: one for the first pair of 3s, another for the second pair, and a third for the two 6s. This makes Threes significantly harder.

###Control and Precognition

While Threes is a lot harder than 2048, it also gives the player some very important tools to combat this. One of them is the ability to control the placement of the new blocks that come on to the board. In 2048, whenever you make a move a new block gets spawned in a random empty spot on the board. In Threes, the same thing happens, except there's an indicator above the board that lets you know if the upcoming block is a 1, 2, 3, or a higher number. Then, instead of spawning in a random spot, the new block will slide onto the board in the direction of your move. These two mechanics combined gives the player a lot of control (but not complete control) over how the board plays out, and knowing and controlling the next block is Threes's third Vector of Play.

Another tool Threes gives players is the ability to foresee the outcome of a move before executing it. If you swipe without lifting your finger, you can see which blocks will combine and where they will all move to, and if you don't like it, you can move your finger back and try other moves instead. It should be noted that [a browser-based remake of Threes released even before 2048]() lacked this feature, which was a dealbreaker for many players. In 2048 this feature was completely unnecessary because of the lessened difficulty from the sliding mechanics and lack of 1s and 2s.
